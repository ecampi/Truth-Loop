Meeting notes (by Escher C):

- the most important thing is that it's scalable
- they want to leave the picking of the CMS up to us
- concrete5 is pretty popular and is close to the requirements
     -well documented
     -more like general CMS than video CMS - but that could be an advantage right??
     -it seems like it's fully free

-watson uses php
-concrete5 doesn't seem super development friendly
-might be a good idea to demo or test each of the CMS with the truth loop system
-watson media doesn't really give an advantage compared to the other CMS
